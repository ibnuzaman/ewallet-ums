- [x] Support for required environment variables

### HTTP Server
- [x] Graceful shutdown with signal handling
- [x] Proper timeouts (read, write, idle)
- [x] Context-aware operations
- [x] Configurable port from environment

### Middleware
- [x] Request logging with structured logs
- [x] Panic recovery
- [x] Request ID tracking
- [x] Request timeout
- [x] Real IP extraction

### Logging
- [x] Structured logging (Logrus)
- [x] Environment-based log level
- [x] JSON format for production
- [x] Pretty format for development
- [x] Request context in logs

### API Response
- [x] Standardized response format
- [x] Success/error distinction
- [x] Request ID in responses
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes
- [x] Consistent error handling

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests for services
- [x] Unit tests for API handlers
- [x] Mock implementations for testing
- [x] 100% test coverage for core logic
- [x] Table-driven tests where applicable

### Error Handling
- [x] Proper error propagation
- [x] Error logging with context
- [x] No sensitive data in error responses
- [x] Graceful degradation

### DevOps
- [x] Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- [x] Non-root user in container
- [x] Health check endpoint
- [x] Docker Compose for local development
- [x] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [x] Makefile for common operations

### Code Quality
- [x] GolangCI-lint configuration
- [x] Go fmt applied
- [x] Go vet passed
- [x] Proper naming conventions
- [x] Code comments where needed

### Documentation
- [x] README with clear instructions
